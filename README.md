# NTU-Randomness-Testing-System
This is a Randomness Test Suite made in Python for testing the randomness of numbers generated by the Random Number Generator referring to NIST SP800-22 Statistical Test Suite.

The NIST has documented 15 statistical tests each focusing on a particular type of non-randomness detection of arbitrary long binary sequences produced by either hardware or software-based cryptographic random or pseudorandom number generators. Referring to these tests, I developed a randomness testing system in Python to test the quality of Random Number Generators (if the generated sequence is truly random or not).

# Requirements and Installations
The dataset given as input was a text file containing 1000 blocks of 20-bit size each. These sequences were taken from an online Random Number Generator for initial development of the system. Later the system was tested using the outputs of TRNG. 

System was developed using the Python 3.10 version and PyCharm IDE.
Required packages/modules : NumPy, SciPy, Math

We get the output in the ‘results’ folder in ‘.csv’ format for each individual test. We can also see pass and fail percentage on the terminal for each test case.
